# Forum Documentation

## Introduction
Forum is a web application designed for community sharing of ideas and challenges within the ProGrowing web platform. It provides users with a platform to engage in discussions, ask questions, share experiences, and seek advice from others in the ProGrowing community.

## Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- Material-UI (MUI): A popular React UI framework implementing Google's Material Design.
- ForumAPI: A backend API built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It serves as the data source for the Forum frontend, providing endpoints for user authentication, posting, commenting, liking, and other features.

## Features

2. **Post Creation**: Users can create new posts to share their thoughts, ideas, or questions with the community.
3. **Post Viewing**: Users can view posts created by others in the community.
4. **Post Interaction**: Users can like, dislike, and comment on posts.
5. **Commenting**: Users can comment on posts to provide feedback, ask questions, or engage in discussions.
6. **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
